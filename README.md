# Instacart Customer Analysis
This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for analysing customer data and grocery shopping behaviour on the Instacart platform.

## Project Overview
This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of customer data from Instacart, an online grocery store. This project was undertaken as part of the Data Analysis course with Career Foundry. The primary goal of this project is to uncover valuable insights into customer behaviour, purchase patterns, and preferences. By analysing customer data, the aim is to inform effective marketing strategies and improve customer segmentation.

## Business Questions
- What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day?
- Are there any particular times of the day when people spend the most money?
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? 
- Which departments have the highest frequency of product orders?
- What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty? 
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status or region? 
- Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits? 
- What different classifications does the demographic information suggest (age, income, certain types of goods, family status)? 
- What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? 

## Data Overview
Instacart is a real company that’s made their data available online. However, the customer data has been fabricated for the purpose of the Career Foundry’s Data Analytics program.
